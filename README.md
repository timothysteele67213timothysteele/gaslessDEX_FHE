# gaslessDEX_FHE: A DEX for Privacy-Enhanced, Gasless Transactions

gaslessDEX_FHE is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that empowers users to conduct transactions with complete privacy, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This innovative platform allows users to trade without the need for gas fees, thanks to meta-transactions, ensuring a user-friendly experience that prioritizes confidentiality.

## The Problem We're Solving

In the current landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), users often face challenges related to high gas fees, transaction delays, and privacy concerns. Traditional DEXs require users to pay gas fees for each transaction, which can be a significant barrier for many, particularly during periods of network congestion. Moreover, the lack of privacy in transaction details poses a serious risk, as sensitive information can be exposed on the blockchain.

## The FHE Solution: Privacy and Efficiency Combined

gaslessDEX_FHE addresses these issues by employing **Zama's FHE technology** to encrypt transaction details and signatures. This ensures that while transactions are executed on-chain, the underlying data remains private and secure. By integrating Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, we enable users to perform trades without revealing their transaction details to the public.

The meta-transaction mechanism allows users to submit their encrypted transactions through a relay service, which pays the gas fees on their behalf. This innovative approach transforms the trading experience, providing both privacy and a gasless environment, thus catering to users who prioritize security and ease of use.

## Key Features

- ðŸ”’ **FHE-Encryped Transaction Details:** All sensitive transaction information is encrypted, ensuring that only the involved parties can view the relevant data.
- ðŸš€ **Gasless Transactions:** Users can trade without worrying about gas fees, making it accessible even during high-demand periods.
- ðŸ”„ **Meta-Transaction Support:** Allows for a seamless trading experience where gas fees can be covered by a relay service.
- ðŸ‘¤ **Enhanced Privacy:** Users have complete control over their transaction data, securing their financial privacy.
- ðŸ“ˆ **User-Centric Interface:** A minimalist design that simplifies the trading process, making it easy for users to navigate the platform.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Core technology for confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: For server-side JavaScript execution.
- **Hardhat**: Local Ethereum development framework for compiling and testing smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: Programming language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Directory Structure

Below is the directory structure of the gaslessDEX_FHE project:

```
gaslessDEX_FHE/
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gaslessDEX_FHE.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deploy.js
â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gaslessDEX_FHE.test.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ hardhat.config.js
```

## Installation Guide

To set up the gaslessDEX_FHE project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **Hardhat** installed on your machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. After installation, ensure that your environment is configured correctly to run the project.

## Build & Run Guide

To compile and test the gaslessDEX_FHE smart contract, use the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Compile Contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the Smart Contract:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

This will deploy the `gaslessDEX_FHE` smart contract to your specified Ethereum network, ready for use.

## Code Example

Here is a brief code snippet demonstrating how to create a new gasless transaction using the DEX:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function createGaslessTrade(tokenA, tokenB, amount) {
    const gaslessDEX = await ethers.getContract("gaslessDEX_FHE");
    const tx = await gaslessDEX.createTrade(tokenA, tokenB, amount, {
        gasLimit: 100000,
    });
    console.log("Trade created successfully:", tx.hash);
}

// Example usage
createGaslessTrade("0xTokenAAddress", "0xTokenBAddress", ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"));
```

This function allows users to initiate trades securely and privately on the gaslessDEX_FHE platform.
